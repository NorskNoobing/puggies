# Puggies

Puggies is a self-hosted CS:GO demo analyzer and statistics platform.

## Development

### Running the backend
The path to the demo file is hard-coded in the main.go file so you'll need to change
that.

Works with FACEIT, ESEA and pugsetup demos

```
cd backend
go run main.go
```

### Running the frontend
```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```
