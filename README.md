# CSGO Demo Stats Parser

Parses some stats from a CSGO demo file.

## Running the backend
The path to the demo file is hard-coded in the main.go file so you'll need to change
that.

Works with FACEIT and pugsetup (my server) demos

```
cd backend
go run main.go
```

## Running the frontend
```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```
